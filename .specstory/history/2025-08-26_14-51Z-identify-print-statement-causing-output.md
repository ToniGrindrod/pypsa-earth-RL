# Identify print statement causing output (2025-08-26 14:51Z)

_**User**_

what print statement in my code is causing this to print

{'Generator-slack-p-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Generator=ZA0 0 coal]': 16574.58648962293, 'Line-fix-s-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Line=lines new ZA0 0 <-> ZA1 0 AC]': 439.1957693164211, 'Line-fix-s-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Line=lines new ZA0 0 <-> ZA3 0 AC]': 15.711346598611613}

I'll help you find which print statement is causing this output. Let me examine the notebook file.

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me search for print statements in the notebook that might be outputting dictionary data:

---



---

Let me search more specifically for print statements that might output dictionaries with constraint names:

---



---

Now let's search for print statements that might output dictionaries with the specific keys in your output:

---



---

Let's look for print statements that might be printing the `info["constraint_violations"]` dictionary:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me check the context around the first occurrence of `print(info["constraint_violations"])`:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me check the context around line 77:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me check around line 77 more precisely:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me look at a broader range around line 77:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me search for the first occurrence of `print(info["constraint_violations"])` with more context:

---



---

Let me try a different approach to find the specific print statement:

---



---

Let me check the exact lines where the constraint violations are being printed:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me check around line 1581:

---

Read file: undefined

---

Let me search for the print statements that show constraint violations:

---



---

Now I can see the print statements that are causing the output. There are multiple occurrences of `print(info["constraint_violations"])` in the notebook. These are located at lines 77, 374, 2362, 2453, 2544, 2635, and 2726.

These print statements are inside blocks of code that are sampling random states to calculate an offset parameter `k`. During this process, the code takes random actions in a temporary environment and then prints out the constraint violations that occur.

The output you're seeing is the dictionary of constraint violations from one of these print statements. The specific constraint violations shown in your output are:

1. `Generator-slack-p-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Generator=ZA0 0 coal]`: 16574.58648962293
2. `Line-fix-s-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Line=lines new ZA0 0 <-> ZA1 0 AC]`: 439.1957693164211
3. `Line-fix-s-upper[snapshot=2013-01-01 00:00:00,Line=lines new ZA0 0 <-> ZA3 0 AC]`: 15.711346598611613

These represent violations of upper bounds on generator power output and line capacity constraints during the random sampling process.

To stop this output, you would need to comment out or remove the `print(info["constraint_violations"])` statements in the notebook, particularly in the functions that calculate the offset parameter `k`.
