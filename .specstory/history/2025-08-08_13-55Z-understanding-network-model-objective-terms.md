# Understanding network model objective terms (2025-08-08 13:55Z)

_**User**_

looking at the conifg file and tell me why the network.model.objective contains terms for nominal line capacity e.g. + 2.476e+04 Line-s_nom[5]? i thought i had changed all components to non-extendable? could the term be an operational term instead of expansion planning?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me investigate why your network model objective still contains terms for nominal line capacity despite setting components to non-extendable.

I notice that while you've set many components to non-extendable, there's no explicit configuration for transmission lines. Let me check the default configuration to see how lines are handled:

Based on my investigation, I now understand why you're seeing terms for nominal line capacity in your network model objective despite setting components to non-extendable. Here's the explanation:

The issue is related to the `ll` parameter in your scenario configuration. In your config file, you have:

```yaml
scenario:
  ll: ["copt"]
```

The key finding is in the `set_transmission_limit` function in `scripts/prepare_network.py`, which is called with the `ll` parameter. When `ll` is set to `copt` (or any value where the first character is 'c' and the rest is 'opt'), it makes transmission lines extendable:

```python
def set_transmission_limit(n, ll_type, factor, costs, Nyears=1):
    # ...
    if factor == "opt" or float(factor) > 1.0:
        n.lines["s_nom_min"] = lines_s_nom
        n.lines["s_nom_extendable"] = True
        
        n.links.loc[links_dc_b, "p_nom_min"] = n.links.loc[links_dc_b, "p_nom"]
        n.links.loc[links_dc_b, "p_nom_extendable"] = True
    # ...
```

In your case, `ll_type` is 'c' and `factor` is 'opt', which triggers the condition to set `s_nom_extendable = True` for all lines. This happens regardless of your other settings for extendable carriers.

To fix this, you need to change the `ll` parameter in your config file. Instead of `copt`, you could use a value like `c1.0` which would still use the capital cost constraint but not make lines extendable (since the factor would be 1.0, not 'opt').

Add this to your config file:

```yaml
scenario:
  ll: ["c1.0"]  # Change from "copt" to use a fixed limit
```

This way, the transmission lines will respect your non-extendable settings, and you won't see those terms in the objective function.

_**User**_

what is ll_type and what does ll mean here

---

_**Assistant**_

In PyPSA-Earth, the `ll` parameter refers to "line limit" and controls how transmission line expansion is handled in the model. 

The `ll` parameter has two parts:
1. `ll_type` (first character): Specifies the type of constraint
   - `c`: Cost constraint - limits the total capital cost of transmission expansion
   - `v`: Volume constraint - limits the total volume (length × capacity) of transmission expansion

2. `factor` (remaining characters): Controls the limit value
   - `opt`: Makes lines fully extendable with no limit
   - A number (e.g., `1.0`): Sets the limit as a multiple of existing transmission capacity
   - Values > 1.0 make lines extendable up to that factor
   - Value = 1.0 effectively prevents expansion

In your config, you have `ll: ["copt"]` which means:
- `c`: Cost-based constraint
- `opt`: Optimization with no limit (fully extendable)

This is why your lines are being set as extendable despite your other non-extendable settings. The `ll` parameter is overriding your configuration.

To fix this and make lines truly non-extendable, you should change to `ll: ["c1.0"]` in your scenario section, which would limit transmission to exactly the existing capacity.

---

_**User**_

does the config by default not include unit commitment terms in the objective?

---

_**Assistant**_

Correct, the default PyPSA-Earth configuration does not include unit commitment terms in the objective function. 

Unit commitment modeling (which would include binary variables for generator on/off status, minimum up/down times, start-up costs, and part-load efficiency) is not enabled by default in PyPSA-Earth. The model uses a simplified linear programming approach where generators can be dispatched continuously between their minimum and maximum power output without discrete on/off decisions or associated costs.

If you're seeing terms in the objective function related to nominal capacities (like `Line-s_nom`), these are related to investment decisions (capacity expansion) rather than unit commitment constraints. Your change to `ll: ["c1.0"]` should have fixed the line expansion issue, making the model respect your non-extendable settings.

To enable unit commitment features, you would need to use PyPSA's unit commitment extensions and adjust the configuration accordingly, but this is not part of the standard PyPSA-Earth workflow.

_**User**_

do any of the other terms in the scenario section of the default config set any components to extendable?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the default config file to see if any other terms in the scenario section might set components to extendable.

Let me look at the `opts` parameter in the scenario section, which might affect component extendability:

Let me check the documentation for the `opts` parameter:

---

Read file: undefined

After reviewing all the information, I can provide a comprehensive answer about whether any other terms in the scenario section of the default config set components to extendable:

No, none of the other terms in the scenario section of the default config directly set components to extendable. Here's what each parameter does:

1. `simpl`: Controls network simplification but doesn't affect extendability
2. `ll`: As we've discussed, this is the only parameter that directly sets extendability (for transmission lines when set to "copt")
3. `clusters`: Controls network clustering but doesn't affect extendability
4. `opts`: Contains various options that can affect constraints, but none directly set components to extendable:
   - `Co2L-3h`: Sets CO2 limits and time resolution (3-hour averaging)
   - Other options like `carrier+{c|p|m}factor` can modify costs or potentials but don't change extendability status
5. `planning_horizons`: Sets the target year for planning but doesn't affect extendability
6. `sopts`: Controls sector coupling options but doesn't affect extendability
7. `demand`: Sets demand scenario but doesn't affect extendability

The extendability of components is primarily controlled by:
1. The `ll` parameter for transmission lines (which you've fixed with `c1.0`)
2. The `electricity.extendable_carriers` section (which you've set to empty lists)
3. Individual technology settings like `renewable.onwind.extendable: false` (which you've set correctly)

Your current configuration with `ll: ["c1.0"]` and empty extendable carrier lists should prevent any components from being extendable in your model.

_**User**_

please explain how ll: ["c1.0"] constrains things so that the expansion terms are not included in the objective. Must one specifiy ll under scenario or could we say something inthe config.RSA_nonextendable that would remove the ll specification from the default config?

---

_**Assistant**_

The `ll: ["c1.0"]` parameter works in the following way to constrain transmission expansion:

1. **How it works:**
   - `c` means it's a cost-based constraint on transmission expansion
   - `1.0` means the total cost of transmission is limited to exactly 1.0× the current system's cost
   - When `factor = "opt"` (as in `copt`), the code sets `s_nom_extendable = True` for lines
   - When `factor` is a number (like `1.0`), the code doesn't set `s_nom_extendable = True` but instead adds a global constraint

2. **How it prevents expansion terms in the objective:**
   - With `c1.0`, transmission lines aren't marked as extendable, so no expansion variables appear in the objective function
   - Instead, a global constraint is added that limits the total transmission cost to the current level
   - Since the constraint is set to exactly 1.0× current cost, no expansion is possible

3. **Specifying in your config:**
   - You must specify `ll` under the `scenario` section because it's a wildcard parameter used in the Snakefile workflow
   - The default value from `config.default.yaml` will be used if not overridden
   - You can't simply remove it, but you must override it with your desired value

4. **Alternative approaches:**
   - Instead of using `ll: ["c1.0"]`, you could theoretically create a custom rule in your workflow that explicitly sets `s_nom_extendable = False` for all lines after the prepare_network step
   - However, overriding the `ll` parameter as you've done is the cleaner and more standard approach

The key insight is that the `ll` parameter is deeply integrated into the PyPSA-Earth workflow and naming conventions. It's used to generate filenames and determine which rules to run. That's why you need to specify it rather than remove it - the workflow expects this parameter to exist.

Your current approach with `ll: ["c1.0"]` in `config.RSA_nonextendable.yaml` is the correct way to handle this, as it properly overrides the default `copt` value while maintaining compatibility with the workflow structure.

_**User**_

but won't specifying ll artificially create constraints that aren't really physical to the problem? or does it not matter because the constraint will automatically always be fulfilled with factor equal to1

---

_**Assistant**_

You've raised an excellent point. Let me clarify how the `ll: ["c1.0"]` constraint works in practice:

When you set `ll: ["c1.0"]`, the code adds a global constraint that limits the total transmission cost to exactly 1.0× the current system's cost. However, this constraint is effectively non-binding because:

1. **Non-extendable lines**: Since you've made all components non-extendable through other settings, the lines cannot expand anyway.

2. **Automatically satisfied**: The constraint will always be satisfied exactly because:
   - The lines have fixed capacities (non-extendable)
   - The total cost of the fixed system is exactly 1.0× itself

3. **No artificial limitation**: This constraint doesn't artificially limit your system's operation. It only constrains expansion, which you've already disabled through other means.

4. **Mathematical perspective**: From a mathematical programming perspective, this is adding a redundant constraint that doesn't change the feasible region of your optimization problem.

The reason you still need to specify `ll: ["c1.0"]` instead of removing it entirely is purely technical - the PyPSA-Earth workflow uses this parameter for:
- File naming conventions
- Rule selection in the Snakefile
- Determining which processing steps to apply

So while it does add a constraint to your mathematical model, it's a constraint that's automatically satisfied and doesn't affect the solution. It's essentially just there to prevent the code from making lines extendable (which would happen with the default `copt` setting).

If you're concerned about model purity, you could potentially modify the PyPSA-Earth codebase to allow bypassing this constraint entirely, but that would require deeper changes to the workflow structure.

---

_**User**_

but does the constraint get added to all linopy model constraints?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the constraint does get added to the linopy model constraints. When you specify `ll: ["c1.0"]`, the code in `set_transmission_limit()` function adds a global constraint to the network:

```python
if factor != "opt":
    con_type = "expansion_cost" if ll_type == "c" else "volume_expansion"
    rhs = float(factor) * ref
    n.add(
        "GlobalConstraint",
        f"l{ll_type}_limit",
        type=f"transmission_{con_type}_limit",
        sense="<=",
        constant=rhs,
        carrier_attribute="AC, DC",
    )
```

This creates a constraint named `lc_limit` with type `transmission_expansion_cost_limit` that gets included in the mathematical model when it's converted to linopy format.

While this constraint is redundant (since it will always be satisfied with non-extendable lines), it does:

1. Add a row to the constraint matrix
2. Require the solver to enforce this constraint during optimization
3. Potentially add a small computational overhead

However, this overhead is typically negligible for modern solvers, especially for a simple constraint like this. The solver will likely detect that this is a redundant constraint during presolve and handle it efficiently.

If you're concerned about model purity or solver performance, you could modify the PyPSA-Earth codebase to bypass adding this constraint when all lines are non-extendable, but that would require changes to the core code rather than just configuration adjustments.
