The `google.colab` package is specifically designed for Google Colab environments and isn't directly installable in a local virtual environment. However, I can help you set up a similar environment locally.

To use functionality similar to Google Colab in your local environment, you'll need to install several packages. Since you're working with PyPSA-Earth and have a Jupyter environment already set up, here's what you can do:

---

```bash
conda activate pypsa-earth
```

```
antoniagrindrod@Antonias-MacBook-Pro-2 pypsa-earth-RL % conda activate pypsa-earth                         c
onda activate pypsa-earth
zsh: command not found: conda
antoniagrindrod@Antonias-MacBook-Pro-2 pypsa-earth-RL %
```

---

Let me try a different approach:

---

```bash
which conda
```
