How to contribute
##########################################

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! 
Every little bit helps, and you always earn credits.

You can contribute on the code side in many ways:

- submit feedback,
- add new features,
- report bugs, 
- fix bugs, 
- implement a new cluster/cloud computation backend,
- write documentation

Code related. For linting, formatting and checking your code contributions
against our guidelines (e.g. we use `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ as code style
and aim for `REUSE compliance <https://reuse.software/>`_),
use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/index.html>`_:

1. Installation ``conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`` or ``pip install pre-commit``
2. Usage:
    * To automatically activate ``pre-commit`` on every ``git commit``: Run ``pre-commit install``
    * To manually run it: ``pre-commit run --all``

Non code related.
If you are interested in non-code related activities then have a look at the `project structure <https://pypsa-meets-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project_structure_and_credits.html>`_ & click on the 'leader' position.
A pdf file will show up, introducing you to other activities in the roam of HR, finance to outreach.
