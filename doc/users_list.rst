* Power system modeling for **Korea** to support development of the national energy strategy, considering ESS Capacity expansion, LMP & Cost analysis according to ESS combination, and coal phase-out scenario (`Energy Innovation Lab <https://energyinnovation.korea.ac.kr/>`_ at `Korea University <https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do>`_)

* Development a model for the **Pakistan** Power System (Soon available on GitHub in PyPSA-Earth's repository) cross-referenced and validated with national reports. The model has been used to develop the Net-Zero scenario by 2050 utilizing Pakistan's eligible Wind and Solar potential. The modeling study has been done as a part of Master Work in Mehran University of Engineering and Technology as presented in the `post <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdulkarimshah_thesisdefense-gratitude-energymodeling-activity-7268980842490724352-mp_M/>`_

* Investigation of implications of the national decarbonisaiton goals for power system of **Kazakhstan**. Traditionally, Kazakhstan’s power sector is using a lot of coal, while the national plans introduce a significant increase in solar and wind generation during the next decades. Model Kazakhstan power system has been used to investigate economic feasibility of going beyond the official mid-term goal of 15% renewable energy share by 2030. Exploring more ambitious energy transition pathways for Kazakhstan has been is subject of a joint project developed by Open Energy Transition and Agora Energiewende which `report <https://www.agora-energiewende.org/publications/modernising-kazakhstans-coal-dependent-power-sector-through-renewables>`_ has been published openly.

* **Multi-Country Electricity Transition Potential and Challenges Project** (MCET) of `Environmental Defence Fund <https://www.edf.org/work/economics-energy-transition#:~:text=The%20Multi%2DCountry%20Electricity%20Transition,to%20decarbonize%20their%20electricity%20sectors>`_. The goal was to analyze barriers to decarbonization in **China**, **India**, **Colombia**, **Chile**, **Kazakhstan**, **Bangladesh**, **Vietnam** and **Thailand** for power system planning in deep decarbonization scenarios.

* Investigation of the energy transition pathways for **Nigeria** published in a `research paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121096>`_ by a joint team of PyPSA-Earth developers. Capabilities of PyPSA-Earth model has been showcased by considering two least-cost power system optimizations, one for 2020 to reproduce the historical system behaviour and one representing a decarbonized 2060 scenario.

* Modeling of the power sector in **Saudi Arabia** published as `MSc dissertation <https://zenodo.org/records/7017741>`_ in Edinburgh University. This has been a first attempt to predict the energy system for Saudi Arabia in 2060, with net zero emissions. The models in this study include a base model for validation, a model for 2030, to compare to the country’s Vision 2030 and as a transition phase, and two models for 2060 net zero, one is fully renewable and the other utilizing carbon capture and storage technology. The outputs of the work are available in the `repository <https://github.com/AnasAlgarei/PyPSA-KSA>`_.
